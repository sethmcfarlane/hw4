1. The amount changes depending on the width of the canvas, but in this case, 40 lines are drawn (a line every 10px on a 400px width canvas).

2. The first establishes where the first x coordinate of the first line will be (10px). The second tells the loop when to stop (the width of the canvas minus 10px). The last determines how much the x coordinate of each line should increase every time the loop runs.
